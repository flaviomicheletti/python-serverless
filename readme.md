**Introduction:** 

The Serverless Framework is a popular open-source tool that simplifies the 
deployment and management of serverless applications. With AWS as the cloud 
provider, this repository offers practical examples written in Python to help 
you understand and implement serverless architectures using AWS Lambda, API 
Gateway, DynamoDB, S3, and CloudWatch Events. 

**Prerequisites:** 

To run the examples in this repository, you should have the following 
prerequisites in place: 

- An AWS account with appropriate IAM permissions
- Node.js and NPM installed on your local machine
- Serverless Framework CLI installed globally

**Getting Started:** 

Follow the steps below to get started with the examples: 

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Configure your AWS credentials using the AWS CLI or environment variables.
4. Navigate to each example directory and follow the README instructions.

**Example 1: AWS Lambda Function:** 

This example demonstrates how to create a simple AWS Lambda function using 
the Serverless Framework. It covers the basic setup, event triggers, and 
handling input/output data. 

**Example 2: API Gateway Integration:** 

In this example, you will learn how to expose your AWS Lambda functions as 
RESTful APIs using API Gateway. It showcases request handling, response 
customization, and authorization. 

**Example 3: Event Triggers and CloudWatch Events:** 

Here, you will explore how to trigger serverless functions based on events 
from various sources using CloudWatch Events. This example covers event 
configuration and function subscriptions. 

**Example 4: DynamoDB Integration:** 

This example focuses on integrating AWS Lambda functions with DynamoDB, 
demonstrating CRUD operations, batch processing, and DynamoDB stream 
processing. 

**Example 5: S3 Bucket Event Notifications:** 

Learn how to process events triggered by actions in an S3 bucket. This 
example illustrates how to handle object creation, deletion, and modification 
events. 

**Example 6: Scheduled Jobs with CloudWatch Events:** 

Discover how to schedule and execute serverless functions on a regular basis 
using CloudWatch Events. This example demonstrates creating recurring tasks 
and time-based triggers.
